# Introduction

In this project I will try out the core concepts of Apache Airflow. To complete 
this project, I will need to create my own custom operators to perform tasks 
such as staging the data, filling the data warehouse, and running checks on the
data as the final step.

# Background

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce 
more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come 
to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

As their data engineer, I'm tasked to create high grade data pipelines that are 
dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. 
They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are 
executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets 
after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data
warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that 
tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs 
the users listen to.

# Datasets

I'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

 - Song data: `s3://udacity-dend/song_data`
 - Log data: `s3://udacity-dend/log_data`

Log data json path: `s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json`

## Songs

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song](http://millionsongdataset.com/) Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{
    "num_songs": 1,
    "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7",
    "artist_latitude": null,
    "artist_longitude": null,
    "artist_location": "",
    "artist_name": "Line Renaud",
    "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1",
    "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff",
    "duration": 152.92036,
    "year": 0
}
```

## Logs

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset I'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, `2018-11-12-events.json`, looks like.

# Development environment
This project is implemented using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).
We can spin up a local Airflow environemnt using `Docker Compose` from the root
of this project:

```shell
docker-compose up
```
